advice: Integrating with TIBCO BusinessWorks JMS queues from a Spring application
  requires vendor-specific implementation, so the application will use the TIBCO JMS
  client library for publishing to these types of queues. The application can provide
  this synchronous request/response behavior by using TIBCO on-demand response queue
  per request. Refer to cookbook URIs
